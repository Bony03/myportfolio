                    <p>
                      My name is Bogdan, and in 2021, at 24 years old, I fully
                      decided to become a web developer, marking the beginning
                      of a new chapter in my life that led me here. I must say
                      that thoughts about programming have been pursuing me
                      since high school. So in my defense, I even try to pursue
                      a degree in programming at university, but due to high
                      competition and the inability to afford tuition fees, I
                      haven't been enrolled. Instead I take place in NAU,
                      majoring in Telecommunication systems and networks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After moving to Kyiv, I tried to find a job and establish
                      myself with a stable income, aiming to become independent.
                      I decide join to a major gambling holding company,
                      Parimatch. So that's why I got there, where else could I
                      find a good salary if not in the world of gambling?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I spent 4.5 years there. I want to emphasize that when I
                      commit to something, I do it well. I started there as a
                      customer support specialist because of the favorable
                      schedule and decent pay, and within 1.5 years, I had a
                      mentor, ranking third among my peers. I worked in that
                      position for 3.5 years and then transitioned to the
                      Business Department of Parimatch UA, where I worked for
                      1.1 years until its closure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While working at Parimatch, I constantly sought to find my
                      true calling. Even before its closure, I had already
                      planned to change my career path to become a web-developer
                      and started studying the relevant materials besides of
                      working hours. Although I wanted to switch professions,
                      but I still wished to continue working at Parimatch, as it
                      was one of the prominent product-oriented IT company in
                      the industry. Therefore, prior to their unexpected
                      closure, I had already acquired knowledge in HTML, CSS,
                      SCSS, JS, React, and Redux. And since it was impossible to
                      enter their company as a Junior simply through an open
                      vacancy, the opportunity only arose after completing their
                      Academy, where they trained future employees according to
                      their specific requirements. So I waiting for the opening
                      of the front-end course in Parimatch Academy. However,
                      fate took a different turn, and Parimatch closed abruptly.
                      More than 2,000 employees lost their jobs, including me.

                      I shared this story to illustrate through my life
                      experiences that planning ahead may not always yield the
                      expected results. It's important to take action here and
                      now, so I'm ready to move forward, albeit on a different
                      path. If you share my vision of the world and are ready to
                      strive for greatness together, here and now, then let's
                      not waste any time. Click the button below and message me!
